VirtualProctor
==============

This is a utility (web site) that we created to help TKP teachers to better teach a group of students. 
Virtual Proctor shows (via screeshot capture) what the status of each pair of students is.

Contact us via GitHub to get instructions on how to implement this utility as part of your TKP class.
